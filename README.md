HTTPS secures(encrypts) data between client and server by Secure Socket layer using RSA algorithm(Product of 2 large prime numbers and an auxillary value).

It is easy to have a product of 2 large prime numbers, but very difficult getting back the original prime numbers by factorization, hence its advantage only when large enough prime numbers are used.
